This repository provides a way to track the image corpus and associated metadata as described by:

Dillen Mathias. (2018). A benchmark dataset of herbarium specimen images with label data: Summary [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6372393

and associated publications using [Preston](https://preston.guoda.bio), a biodiversity dataset tracker.

```index.json``` - a json-ld presentation of specimen metadata, generated by build.sh

```data/``` - a preston data archive consisting of the summary csv and associated data

```README.md``` - this file

```build.sh``` - script that tracks the image dataset and creates associated products like index.json
