# preston-dillen-2018

This repository provides a way to track the image corpus and associated metadata as described by:

Dillen Mathias. (2018). A benchmark dataset of herbarium specimen images with label data: Summary [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6372393

and associated publications using [Preston](https://preston.guoda.bio), a biodiversity dataset tracker. 

:warning: this is an experimental data repository :warning: 

:warning: note that the Zenodo remote functionality is still under development; see https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/152 :warning:

## contents

```README.md``` - this file

```build.sh``` - script that tracks the image dataset and creates associated products like index.json

```data/``` - a preston data archive consisting of the summary csv and associated data

```index.json``` - a json-ld presentation of specimen metadata, generated by build.sh

## usage


### update

to update the data associated with the Dillen 2018 corpus, install Preston, jq, and re-run:

```shell
./build.sh 
```

Depending on your network connectivity and Zenodo server response times, this process may take a while. If you don't want to rely on the internet, suggest to use the clone feature described next. 


### clone
To work with a previously captured version of the image corpus (and it's associated images) locally, suggest to run:

```shell
preston clone --algo md5 --remote https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bio-guoda/preston-dillen-2018/main/data,https://zenodo.org
```

Please note that the associated (heavy) images are stored in Zenodo, whereas (lightweight) indexes, metadata and json snippets can be retrieved from this repository. Note that downloading the >200GB corpus may take awhile depending on your internet connection speed or the load on Zenodo's valuable web services.   

Alternatively, you can use git/github to clone the metadata, then retrieve the (heavy) image object from Zenodo if needed:

### find 

You can use the generated index.json to find the specimen records that you are interested in. 

For instance, you can use jq in combination with ```head``` to find the first 2 specimen record of genus ```Abelia``` 

```shell
cat index.json\
| jq --compact-output '.["@graph"][] | select(.["dwc:genus"] == "Abelia")'\
| head -n2\
| jq .
```

with expected output:

```json

would select all available specimen records. 


### image processing

Now, select some tiff images using:

```
preston ls --algo md5 -l tsv\
| grep hasVersion\
| grep tif\
| cut -f3\
| grep hash://\
| head
 ```

 produces:

```
hash://md5/a5ccffe5fe22aca505acdaf41c42906b
hash://md5/b35348aa71090a1f80e9d3fe8def8371
hash://md5/37fde5ff1d29e2f21fdb6bcfaef2fe19
hash://md5/56407fa802d0189b9b69f24b30d0242b
hash://md5/349696f3a0fda2ceb798fabfdb367262
hash://md5/0eb416c5561818003c37c211691fb455
hash://md5/9029736abb31c1f01646cd5d41d55c8d
hash://md5/9c0fddd7529d5d114bb716dac40106be
hash://md5/96d0349faf932032f43a7e90ec73ab3e
hash://md5/00127099bf5e2035ad76b45979ca5504
```

These are hashes (or content ids) associated with tracked tiff images. 

Exact one into a file using Zenodo as a remote image repository (i.e. ```--remote https://zenodo.org```) without caching a local copy (i.e. ```---no-cache```) :  

```
preston cat --algo md5 hash://md5/a5ccffe5fe22aca505acdaf41c42906b --remote https://zenodo.org --no-cache > some.tiff
```

and open the large image file (> 100MB) in your favorite images processing program, or process it futher.

Note that this uses Zenodo to lookup the image by their md5 hash (for background, see https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/149). In other words, Preston asks for content with a specific content hash, and Zenodo finds one if it has it.

Also note that this ```preston cat ...``` example above would work anywhere as long as: (1) you have an internet connection (2) Zenodo is up and running, and (3) installed a version of Preston.
